# Is Chaos Good for Reservoir Computing?

This repisotory is for Honours thesis **Is Chaos Good For Reservoir Computing?** done in University of Aberdeen and code to replicate research results.

Main research areas:
- Created new RNN machine learning architectures based on Reservoir Computing (RC) from ground up to create a model specifically to predict chaotic signals
- Collaborated with UoA Physics department head to find a novel Collective Almost Synchronization (CAS) network model.
- Contributed to and outlined research areas for improving prediction of chaotic signals using RC

Table of contents in this repository:
- [Thesis.pdf](https://github.com/justsvykas/Is-Chaos-Good-For-Reservoir-Computing-/blob/main/Thesis.pdf) you can find the main results of research done
- Inside [Code_for_Honours_thesis.ipynb](https://github.com/justsvykas/Is-Chaos-Good-For-Reservoir-Computing-/blob/main/Code_for_Honours_thesis.ipynb) is all the code needed to achieve results in Thesis.pdf
